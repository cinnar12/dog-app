  <h2>Doggo Lingo</h2>
  <p>Doggo Lingo is an Internet language trend inspired by a shared love of dogs. Before its invention, when a dog or puppy was being extremely cute or funny, there weren't enough words to describe it. Thus, the Internet created words like doggo, pupper, floof, sploot, boof, bork and much more. These cutesy words appeared in memes and posts and soon the language spread to meme phrases that described dog memes.</p>
