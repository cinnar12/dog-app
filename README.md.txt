WEEK 1
I ended up changing my concept a bit to popular dogs that one would find on Facebook or in memes nowadays. My audience will be teens and adults who are often on the internet and may or may not know about the significance of dogs on the internet.

I created an index page and a lingo page. There will be three pages in total: home page, browse page and terminology page. So far the index page has the text and two buttons. The lingo page has text and a table. I was working on a navbar for the second page so that people can navigate to the other pages.

I didn't get to finish the home page as planned because I had a few issues stylizing the navbar to make it stay put and be responsive, and I haven't finished editing all the dog photos and soundclips. I'll keep playing around with the navbar because I've made a reponsive one before which I might look back on. I'll also look up any fixes to why the positioning is weird.
