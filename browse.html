            <h3>Chihuahua</h3>
            <p><i>They are the handbag yappers known for their sassiness and featured in many movies and with celebrities.</i>
              <br><br>
              Chihuahuas are small sized dogs with big personalities in the companion dog group. They tend to not be friendly towards other dogs and see them as hostile toward their owners. They like nothing more than to be close to their owners at all times, so people tend to carry these dogs along when they travel.
